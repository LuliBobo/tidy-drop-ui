### 4. Component Updates
- Fixed `FileCleaner.tsx` to use safer Electron access patterns
- Updated `SettingsModal.tsx` with proper web fallbacks
- Fixed type errors in conditional rendering

### 5. Build Process
- Added `prepare-netlify-env.js` to set environment variables during build
- Updated `netlify.toml` with proper function timeout configuration
- Enhanced build commands to correctly set environment state

### 6. Documentation
- Created `CROSS-PLATFORM-GUIDE.md` with best practices
- Updated `NETLIFY-DEPLOYMENT.md` with detailed deployment instructions
