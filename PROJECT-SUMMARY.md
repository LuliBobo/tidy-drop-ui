# DropTidy Project Summary

## Project Overview

DropTidy is a simple, focused application for removing metadata from photos and videos. It addresses privacy concerns by stripping location data, camera information, and other potentially sensitive metadata from media files.

## Simplified Architecture

The project has been completely simplified from its previous complex state, resulting in a clean, focused application that accomplishes its core purpose.

### Key Components:

1. **Core Components**
   - `src/App.tsx` - Main application layout
   - `src/components/Dropzone.tsx` - File upload and processing interface
   - `src/utils/removeMetadata.ts` - Cross-platform metadata removal utility

2. **Platform Support**
   - Web browser application (uses client-side canvas processing)
   - Electron desktop application (uses ExifTool for comprehensive metadata removal)

3. **Branch Structure**
   - `main` - Core application branch
   - `local` - Testing branch
   - `net` - Web deployment branch

## Issues Resolved

1. **White Screen Problem**
   - Fixed by simplifying the application structure
   - Eliminated complex routing and authentication that was breaking the UI
   - Ensured proper Content Security Policy for both web and Electron environments

2. **Branch Complexity**
   - Reduced from multiple conflicting branches to three clear-purpose branches
   - Implemented clean merge strategy to keep branches synchronized

3. **Code Complexity**
   - Removed unnecessary components and dependencies
   - Simplified to focus exclusively on core functionality
   - Eliminated broken authentication and routing code

## Technical Implementation

### Web Application
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for fast builds
- Client-side canvas processing for metadata removal

### Desktop Application 
- Electron framework
- IPC communication for secure data exchange
- ExifTool integration for comprehensive metadata removal
- FFmpeg for video processing

## Deployment

Deployment instructions are available in `DEPLOYMENT.md`, including:
- Web deployment via Netlify
- Desktop application packaging for Windows, macOS and Linux
- Update and maintenance procedures

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements while maintaining simplicity:

1. **Enhanced Metadata Viewer**
   - Allow users to see what metadata is being removed

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Improve handling of multiple files

3. **Enhanced Video Processing**
   - Better support for video metadata in web environment

4. **Offline Web Version**
   - Progressive Web App capabilities
