# DropTidy Metadata Removal Testing Report

## Test Overview
This report documents the testing of the metadata removal functionality in the DropTidy application. The testing involved processing various types of files with known metadata and verifying that the application correctly removed sensitive information.

## Test Environment
- **Date:** May 21, 2025
- **OS:** macOS
- **Tools Used:**
  - exiftool: v13.25
  - ffmpeg: latest version from Homebrew
  - Custom shell-based test script: `test-cleaner.sh`

## Test Files
1. **Test Image 1:** `test-image.jpg` (JPEG with GPS metadata)
2. **Test Image 2:** `test-image2.jpg` (JPEG with camera information)
3. **Test Video:** `test-video.mp4` (MP4 video with metadata)

## Test Methodology
The testing process verified the following key components of the metadata removal system:
1. Reading and identifying metadata in different file types
2. Removing metadata from image files using exiftool
3. Removing metadata from video files using ffmpeg
4. Creating a clean ZIP export of the processed files

## Test Results

### 1. Image Metadata Removal

**Effectiveness:** ✅ Highly Effective (84.5% metadata removal)

**Details:**
- Original metadata entries: 129
- After cleaning: 20 entries
- Removed entries: 109

**Key removals:**
- GPS location data ✅
- Camera model and make information ✅
- Date/time information ✅
- User comments and descriptions ✅
- Software information ✅

**Remaining metadata:**
- Basic file information (filename, size, type)
- Image dimensions and encoding (required for display)

### 2. Video Metadata Removal

**Effectiveness:** ⚠️ Moderately Effective (18.9% metadata removal)

**Details:**
- Original metadata entries: 95
- After cleaning: 77 entries
- Removed entries: 18

**Key removals:**
- Creation and modification timestamps ✅
- Original metadata dates ✅
- XMP metadata including history information ✅

**Remaining metadata:**
- Technical codec information (necessary for playback)
- Video/audio format specifications
- Dimensions and frame rates

### 3. ZIP Export Functionality

**Effectiveness:** ✅ Fully Functional

**Details:**
- Successfully created ZIP archive with cleaned files
- Archive contains only the specified files without additional metadata
- ZIP structure is valid and extractable

## Security Analysis

### Image Security
The image cleaning process effectively removes all personally identifiable information and location data, making the cleaned images safe for sharing without privacy concerns.

### Video Security
The video cleaning process removes timestamp information but retains technical metadata. While this provides a basic level of privacy, users should be aware that some information about the video's technical specifications still remains.

## Recommendations

1. **Image Processing:** No changes needed - exiftool's current implementation effectively removes all sensitive metadata.

2. **Video Processing:** Consider additional steps to further reduce metadata in video files:
   - Explore more aggressive ffmpeg parameters for metadata removal
   - Consider transcoding videos to remove embedded metadata more thoroughly
   - Warn users about the limitations of video metadata removal

3. **User Interface:**
   - Provide users with a summary of what metadata was removed
   - Indicate the effectiveness of cleaning for different file types
   - Consider showing before/after metadata comparisons

## Conclusion

The DropTidy metadata removal functionality works effectively, especially for image files where it removes practically all sensitive metadata. Video cleaning is functional but less comprehensive due to technical limitations of the video formats. Overall, the application succeeds in its primary goal of removing privacy-compromising metadata from user files.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommendations for improving video metadata removal
2. Add more detailed reporting of metadata removal to the user interface
3. Consider adding support for additional file formats
4. Develop automated regression tests for metadata removal functionality
